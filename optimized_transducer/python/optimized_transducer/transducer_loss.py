        Args:
          logits:
            A 2-D tensor of shape (sum_all_TU, vocab_size). Suppose you have a
            batch containing two utterances, in a normal setup, the output of
            the joint network is (2, max(T1, T2), max(U1, U2), vocab_size);
            however, in optimized transducer, we expect that you first convert
            (T1, U1, vocab_size) and (T2, U2, vocab_size) to (T1*U1, vocab_size)
            and (T2, U2, vocab_size), respectively; and then concatenate
            (T1*U1, vocab_size) and (T2*U2, vocab_size) to get
            (T1*U1 + T2*U2, vocab_size).

            Caution:
              You need to do the above transformation at the input of the joint
              network to save memory, not at the output of the joint network.
              In other words, you have to modify your joint network to accept
              2-D tensors as inputs and also produce a 2-D tensor as output.
              This is feasible as a joint network usually contains only
              `nn.Linear` and pointwise activation layers, where frames are
              processed independently.

            Caution:
              Its dtype has to be torch.float32 and it has to be contiguous
              in memory.

            Caution:
              If it requires grad and if from_log_softmax is False,
              then it shares the same memory with its gradient. That is, after
              the call, its original value is overwritten with its gradient.

            Hint:
              `logits` contains unnormalized probabilities and it is usually the
              output of some `nn.Linear` layer if `from_log_softmax` is False.
              Otherwise, `logits` should be the output of `log-softmax`.
          targets:
            A 2-D tensor of shape (batch_size, num_tokens) containing  the
            tokens in each utterance.

            Caution:
              Its dtype has to be torch.int32 and has to be contiguous in
              memory. Must be on the same device as `logits`.
          logit_lengths:
            A 1-D tensor of shape (batch_size,) containing the number of output
            frames from the encoder, i.e., `T_i`s

            Caution:
              Its dtype has to be torch.int32 and has to be contiguous in
              memory. Must be on the same device as `logits`.
          target_lengths:
            A 1-D tensor of shape (batch_size, ) containing the number of
            tokens in each utterance before padding.

            Caution:
              It does not count the blank symbol.

            Caution:
              Its dtype has to be torch.int32 and has to be contiguous in
              memory. Must be on the same device as `logits`.
          blank:
            The ID of the blank symbol. Must be 0 <= blank <= logits.size(1)-1.
          from_log_softmax:
            If `True`, then `logits` is the output of `log-softmax`.
            If `False`, then `logits` is the output of some `nn.Linear` layer.

            Caution:
              You should use a `False` value for it and use the output from
              `nn.Linear` if you need to save memory usage.
              Set it to `True` if you want to manipulate the output of
              `log-softmax` before sending it for loss computations.

                          the loss over all utterances in the batch.
            Caution:
              We don't support "none" as it increases the difficulty to compute
              the gradient.
