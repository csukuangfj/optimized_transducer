/** Compute the transducer loss given the output from the joint network.

  @param logits  A 2-D tensor of shape (TU, V), where TU equals to
                 \sum_i (T_i * U_i), where `T_i` is the logit_lengths[i] and
                 `U_i` is `target_lengths[i]` + 1. V is the vocabulary size
                 including the blank.
  @param targets A 1-D tensor of shape (N, ), where N is the batch size.
  @param logit_lengths A 1-D tensor of shape (N, ) containing number of output
                       acoustic frames from the encoder.
  @param target_lengths A 1-D tensor of shape (N, ) containing the input
                        sequence length of each utterance for the decoder.
  @param from_log_softmax If true, `logits` is the output of `log-softmax`;
                          If false, `logits` is the output of `nn.Linear`.
  @return Return a pair containing
          - the loss, which is a 1-D tensor of shape (N,)
          - the gradient, it is empty if logits does not require grad.
            Otherwise, its shape is the same as `logits`.
